# Cheap_Flight_SMS_Alert
For any given Destination and price point, this program searches cheap flights for given time frame (for example from tomorrow to next sixth months) for all those destinations and desired
price point and if found any desired flights, notifies the user via sms alert. I've used
kiwi Partners Tequila Location API to find IATA Codes and Tequila Search API to find cheap flights. Twillo API is used to send SMS Alert.
Update 1.0 : Extended Code has now been uploaded. Now any external users can signup to this service using external link and receieve flight alerts delivered to their email or phone everyday with new cheap deals.
